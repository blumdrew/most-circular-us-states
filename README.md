# most-circular-us-states
All of the US states and territories ranked by how circular they are

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Used cb_2017_us_state_5m from US Census for source of shapefiles(https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_state.html)

In order to determine how round each state was, I used the same idea as https://gciruelos.com/what-is-the-roundest-country.html this guy did, but used a (conceptually) simpler implemenation for actually determining the correct radius
